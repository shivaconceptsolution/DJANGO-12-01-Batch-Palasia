Component of class:-

1 Data member:-

Data member means variable's which will be used to define Object Attribute.

Type of Data Member:-

1 Class Type:-

this type of data member will be define into class and share class memory to store data.
Class Type Data member will be called by Classname.

all Class type Member function contain class Type variable .it is also called static variable.

it will allocate only one memory space in complete python program.


2 Instance Type:-
this type of data member will be defined by instance type member function .it will be called by Object.

this type of member function will use self keyword to access under multiple methods.

it will allocate memory at runtime. it has no limit for memory allocation means it can be assigned into multiple memory.



2 Member function:-

member function is used to define data member values and implement functionality to use program logic.
Member function is also used to provide categorization of code into class.


Type of member function

1 Class type:-

it is used to define class type variable.this type of member function will be called by classname .it will allocate single memory allocation in complete program.

class A:
   def fun():
        b=20
        print(b)

A.fun()

 
2 instance type:-

this type of member function is used to define intance variable.insance type member function will be called by object and it has no limit for memory allocation.

self keyword is mandatory in instance type member function which is used to point the address of current object.


class A:
  def fun2(self):
      a=100  #local instance 
      self.b=200 #global instance
      print(a)
      print(self.b)

ref = A()
ref.fun2()


Type of member function according to parameters:-

1 Default



2 Parametrised


3 init method or constructor:-

it is used to initialize instance type data member of class when we create object.

it will be called implicit when we create object.


in python we can create only one constructor because python not support function overloading concept.


class Classname:
    def __init__(self):
          self.a=100
          self.b=200
    def logic(self):
         self.c=self.a+self.b
    def display(self):
        print(self.c)

obj = Classname()
obj.logic()
obj.display()



destructor:-

destructor will be called automatically in python which is used to destroy object.

we will use __del__(self): method for destructor

Data abstraction and Data encapsulation:-
.................................................................................................
abstraction means data hiding.if we want to hide data internal details of an application then we can implement data abstraction concept.

if we want to hide any member function or data member in python than we can use __ symbol infront of method name.




class Classname:
   def __fun(self):
       print("fun")



Data encapsulation :- it is used to bind or pack all details in a single unit.

python completly follow data encapsulation because all instance data will be defined under method.

we should never access secure details directly it should be accessed by another member function using encapsulation.



abstraction and encapsulation is used to provide better security and performance in application.
